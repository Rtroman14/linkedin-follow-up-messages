Max Florsheim,Randy Flint,2020-05-20T14:13:35,Consulting opportunity - Randy Flint,"Hi Randy,   I hope this finds you well despite these challenging times. I work for a primary research firm called Guidepoint that is based in New York City and sources expert advisors for the management consulting community. Currently, I have a client looking to learn about amusement ride OEM pricing and contracting strategies. I came across your LinkedIn profile and figured, given your background, you‚Äôd be an ideal contact for my client to engage with.  During the paid phone consultation nothing proprietary would be asked. My client is really just looking to get a better understanding of this topic at a very high level and hear your perspective. I think my client could really benefit from your insight so I just wanted to reach out and see if this is something you might be interested in.  If interested, we will set you up with a 45-60 minute phone consultation based on your personal availability. You will be compensated for your time at a prorated hourly consulting rate that you get to set for yourself. You would never be asked to discuss any private or confidential information and the next steps will involve a few screening questions so you can better gauge the topic of conversation.. There is no prep work required for the consultations.  The next step here is to follow the link below to become an advisor in our network. This will allow you to view the topic details provided directly by my client and set your desired hourly consulting rate.  Consultation form: http://gpt.io/qpaK3HXR  I certainly understand it is a chaotic time, but please let me know if of interest and happy to discuss further over a call.

Certificate to Maximize Your Leadership Skills,"Hi Randy,We're searching for qualified leaders to apply to our Executive Certificate in Polarities &amp; Paradox. Have you ever grappled with these questions:&bull; Do we do what&rsquo;s best for the bottom line or what&rsquo;s best for the environment?&bull; Do I draw a hard line in the sand or worry about being diplomatic?&bull; Do we want managers to spend time focusing on employees or working faster to achieve more output? &bull; Do I support people to motivate them or challenge them to develop?Our cohort-based program teaches you to see paradox and work with polarities as a tool for change on the personal and organizational level. Leaders who can navigate these contradictions outperform those who have not developed this advanced skill.If this is something you might be interested in, visit our website or simply reply to learn more.
